This page focuses on negative examples related to contribution. The following reasons may cause your issue to be closed without answer:

 - Not providing information about the library version, Android version and device used
 - Not providing sufficient information allowing to solve the problem (`Exception`, textual explanation, ...)
-> "it doesn't work" or "it crashes" is not sufficient, "I'm not able to" is also not sufficient
 - Questions & issues that can be solved using the [example project](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/tree/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample) or the [documentation](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki)
 - Not providing code examples where the issue occurs or some other form of problem description (screenshot, video)
 - Using a language other than English (preferred) or German (if necessary)
 - Excessive creation (spam) of new issues & creation of duplicate issues
 - Improper formatting of issues (no / poor code formatting, no line breaks, ...)
 - Opening issues not directly related to this repository / library

Please understand that maintaining a large repository like this requires a lot of time, and **issues not properly worded cannot be addressed** for that reason. Make sure the issue you are opening does not conform to any of the above mentioned points. Thank you.
